  feeling: Empty
  initialConvo:
  - Heya.
  - 
  - Idk
  - I mean, it's weird
  - I feel like I should be in pieces
  - Crying all over the place
  - But... nothing.
  - My best friend of 16 years just died and I don't feel anything.
  - 
  - 
  - Maybe
  - But I just don't really know what to do anymore.
  initialResponses:
  - 
  - Hi there! How you holding up?

  - Everyone processes grief differently.
  - It's okay to feel the way you feel.
  -

  firstBranch:
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - I guess.
  - That just doesn't really help with the way I feel now
  - 
  - I guess you're right
  - Thanks
  - I'll keep that in mind
  firstBranchResponses:
  - That's understandable.
  - Things will start to feel better soon.
  - Sometimes time is all it takes.
  - 
  - 
  - The only way out is through.

  secondBranch:
  - 
  - 
  - Do you think that will help?
  - 
  - Okay.
  - She was this mutt of a dog called Sunny.
  - Kinda Shiba Inu looking,
  - But also had loose skin kinda like a Shar Pei.
  - 'She absolutely hated water, '
  - But loved playing in the mud
  - A horrible combo really
  - But she was so smart too
  - Always knew how to get away from bath time.
  - Honestly, she was a little diva. But I loved her for it.
  - 
  - She was
  - Man...
  - I'm crying now
  - But like... the good kind of cry I think.
  - I miss her so much.
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - Yeah
  - This is actually helped a little
  - I feel really sad right now, but at least it's better than numb
  - Thank you<3
  secondBranchResponses:
  - Why don't you tell me a little bit about your dog?
  - Anything about them, little quirks or fond memories
  - 
  - It might.

  - She sounds so cute!
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - I can tell you loved her a lot.
  - She had a full and happy life,
  - Hopefully the memories of that can bring you some comfort.
