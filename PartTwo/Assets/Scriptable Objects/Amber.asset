  initialConvo:
  - Hi
  - 
  - I'm doing okay!
  - Well
  - I mean, no actually
  - Things have actually been going pretty shitty.
  - I just got used to saying that I'm fine, you know?
  - 
  - 
  - Thanks :)
  - It's been a while since I've felt like I could talk about myself
  - No one seems to want to listen to me lately.
  - I don't know what happened but like...
  - My friends have been acting kind of weird.
  - Distant.
  - I don't know what I did, or what I can do to fix it :(
  initialResponses:
  - 
  - Hello! How are you doing today?
  -

  - 
  -

  - I get that, it's easier a lot of the time
  - But this is a safe space to express how you really feel.

  firstBranch:
  - 
  - 
  - Maybe...
  - I don't know, I've known these guys for so long.
  - It's kind of hard to just... let go like that
  - ...
  - I'll sleep on it
  - Thanks for listening.
  firstBranchResponses:
  - You deserve better.
  - Maybe it's time to start looking for new friends.

  secondBranch:
  - 
  - Not yet.
  - I'm kind of scared to, since they've been so cold lately
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - Yeah... I guess you're right.
  - I never thought about it that way but
  - Friends who I can't talk to aren't really friends worth keeping
  - Thank you, I feel much better about all this now :)
  secondBranchResponses:
  - Have you tried talking to them?
  - 
  - 
  - It doesn't hurt to try!
  - At the very least you'll get some insight
  - If they aren't willing to listen it might be time to find new friends
  -

  - 
  choiceOne: Have you tried talking to them?
  choiceTwo: You deserve better.
